# Enterprise React in 2020

This is the React stack you need to build a scalable reliable and nice looking SPA you will be proud of in 2020.
Read more about this example in my article on [medium]().

You can see this app in action on github pages [here](https://slava-lu.github.io/enterprise-react-2020/).

## Motivation
React ecosystem is changing rapidly as well as the whole frontend development area. 
I have presented a [similar stack](https://medium.com/@viacheslavlushchinskiy/enterprise-react-in-2018-2019-ae6c80c03f1) last year but due to lots of changes I have created the new updated one. 
If you want to know what has changed since last year, read the [medium article]().

## Installation and Usage
* install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).
* in local project directory run `yarn` to load modules.
* run `yarn start` to start the app.
* run `yarn run build` to build a production app.
